Aman worked on a project to create a new website for our meditation centre. The project involved developing a brand new site which incorporates a new booking and membership system to facilitate our online classes. 

We are very happy with the website. It is very beautiful and meets our stated requirements well. Aman was a delight to work with.

                            Aman did a wonderful job in designing the new website for KMC Birmingham. From producing prototypes to final implementation and post live support  Aman was involved in all aspects of the life cycle...he has a particular eye for detail researching topics such as the security options thoroughly. Aman was a delight to work, happy to take on board suggestions and committed to build a quality product. Highly recommend him.

                              I have always found him to deeply care about every project he has been working on. He researches it thoroughly and tries to always do the best possible job having really thought through his course of action. Aman is a really kind, sincere and very respectful person; a pleasure to work with. I wish him every success with his career path and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him.

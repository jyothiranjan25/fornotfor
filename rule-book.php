						<li>The tournament will follow a British Parliamentary Debate format where there shall be 4 teams participating in one round with two Speakers in each team. Two teams represent the Government (in support of the motion), and two teams represent the Opposition (opposed to the Government and motion). Participants will be informed of their team’s position in a given round just before the motion is announced. </li>
						<li>Here are the general names of the teams and the names of the individual roles: <br> <br>
